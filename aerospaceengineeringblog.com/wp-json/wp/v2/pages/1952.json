Scientific breakthroughs in battery technology, machine learning, 3-D printing, and materials science are changing the way we design aircraft and rockets. These technologies have ushered in a new era in aerospace engineering, which will see transformations in the way we travel locally and to space.<\/p>\n<p>As a university researcher, I interact with many engineers who are working on exciting projects&#8212;from fundamental research in university labs to moon-shot projects in industry. I created the Aerospace Engineering Podcast so that aerospace enthusiasts around the world can listen in on these conversations and catch a glimpse of what the future holds. In each episode, I interview aerospace pioneers about their latest work and the engineering that makes their ideas fly.<\/p>\n<p>What can you expect from the Aerospace Engineering Podcast? Avionics technician Brandon Sanders has written a comprehensive <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engineeringpodcast.com\/index.php\/2018\/06\/21\/aerospace-engineering-podcast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">review of the show<\/a> (and many other engineering podcasts), and in his words:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Rainer tends to accomplish a rare feat in making some of the most complex engineering concepts accessible to even the least educated or experienced, while not watering it down or making them more amateur friendly. &#8212; Brandon Sanders<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/id1299428170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/aerospaceengineeringblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Untitled.png\" width=\"248\" height=\"63\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the Renaissance, many artists received patronage from wealthy families and friends.
