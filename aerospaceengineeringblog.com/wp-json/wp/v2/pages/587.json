My research focus is on lightweight design of engineering structures using composite materials (e.g. carbon-fibre reinforced plastics) and through multi-functional design (i.e. structures that achieve more than one task).<\/p>\n<p>One particular approach that I am researching is to use elastic instabilities to create shape change and adaptivity in materials and structures. For example, we can devise structures that snap between different configurations or have multiple ways of reacting to an applied load, and this is particularly useful for adapting a system to changing operating conditions. This approach is generally known as morphing, and any bird you see has the ability to morph its wings on the fly.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about this research, then check out the dedicated blog <a href=\"https:\/\/aerospaceengineeringblog.com\/a-vision-for-shape-adaptive-aircraft\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post<\/a> that I have written on this topic.<\/p>\n<p>You can find my contact details and further details below.
