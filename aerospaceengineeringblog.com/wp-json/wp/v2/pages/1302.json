The user can input laminates with up to 30 layers and define up to eight different layer materials. The spreadsheet is an easy way to get comfortable with classic laminate analysis calculations.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/aerospaceengineeringblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/CLAP.zip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Composite Laminate Analysis Program (CLAP)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>CLAP is a MATLAB\u00ae routine that performs classical laminate analysis for any general anisotropic layup. The program calculates A, B, D matrices as well as stresses and strains at mid-ply locations and ply-interfaces occurring from mechanical force and moment loading, residual hygrothermal stresses induced by post-cure cool-down and linearly varying moisture distribution through the laminate thickness. The results are output into a results folder and include a text file of layer stresses and strains, and figures of the associated through-thickness stress and strain plots. Before using, please read the attached User Guide, and please reference the program if you use it in your own work\/research.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/aerospaceengineeringblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/ModelThinking.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Model Thinking &#8212; Course Notes<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This document is a collection of lecture notes that I took while taking the course &#8220;Model Thinking&#8221; by Scott E. Page, Professor of Complex Systems, Political Science, and Economics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Any errors and omissions in these notes are naturally entirely my own, and all credit for the content goes to Scott. Needless to say, these lecture notes are by no means a substitute for his awesome course. Rather, consider this document as a primer to thinking with qualitative and quantitative models; either to think more clearly, make better decisions or be more informed about the world around you. If you enjoy these lecture notes, then I highly recommend that you try out Scott&#8217;s course.
